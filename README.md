# DjangoAngular

Backend = Looking to the client/server architecture, we call as the backend,
the layer responsible for managing the access on the data,
and its processing happens entirely on the server that is responsible for the service
The backend is responsible for accessing, processing, storing,
and controlling the access to the data requested by the client.
The most famous implementations of it are the REST APIâ€™s.

Frontend = On the other hand, the frontend is responsible for the presentation layer of your application,
and most of the work usually happens on the client-side.
